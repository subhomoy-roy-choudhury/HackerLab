# Disable proxy buffering
# This directive controls whether the response should be buffered. Disabling buffering can be useful for streaming
# or if the response size is large or expected to arrive quickly. It ensures that the data is sent to the client as
# soon as it is received from the proxied server.

# Define the number and size of buffers used for reading a response.
# Here '4 256k' means that up to 4 buffers, each of size 256 kB, can be used to store the response from the proxy server.
# This is helpful for handling larger responses efficiently.
